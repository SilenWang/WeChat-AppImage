# Bypass WeChat Login Detection

The files in this folder are used to bypass WeChat login detection. The WeChat client is only allowed to be used on specific Linux distributions. This is a workaround to bypass the login detection.

These files are extracted from WeChat for [Ubuntu Kylin](https://www.ubuntukylin.com/applications/106-cn.html).

To get the files, run the following commands:

```bash
wget http://archive.ubuntukylin.com/software/pool/partner/weixin_2.1.1_amd64.deb
ar x ./weixin_2.1.1_amd64.deb
tar -xvf ./data.tar.xz
```
